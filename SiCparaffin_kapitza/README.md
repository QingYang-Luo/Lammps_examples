# Interfacial thermal resistance(kapitza)
This work calculated the interfacial thermal resistance via NEMD method.  

log.lammps gives the thermo print, and the heat flux along with simulation time of source and sink can be extracted from it.

temp_50.txt and temp_100.txt give the temperature gradient of the system when it is divided into 50 and 100 chunks, respectively.
